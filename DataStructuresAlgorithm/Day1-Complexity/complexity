Character Output Format
d,i Integer
u Unsigned Integer
f Floating point as m.ddddd
e Floating point as m.ddddde+/-xx
E Floating point as m.dddddE+/-xx
g Use %e for exponents less than âˆ’4 or greater than +5, otherwise us %f
c Single character
s String, or any Python data object that can be converted to a string by using the str
function
% Insert a literal % character

The % operator is a string operator
called the format operator. The left side of the expression holds the template or format string,
and the right side holds a collection of values that will be substituted into the format string.

print(name, "is", age, "years old.")

print("%s is %d years old." % (name, age))



you can also include a format modifier between the % and
the format character. Format modifiers may be used to left-justify or right-justify the value
with a specified field width. Modifiers can also be used to specify the field width along with a
number of digits after the decimal point.


Modifier Example Description
number %20d Put the value in a field width of 20
- %-20d Put the value in a field 20 characters wide, left-justified
+ %+20d Put the value in a field 20 characters wide, right-justified
0 %020d Put the value in a field 20 characters wide, fill in with leading zeros
. %20.2f Put the value in a field 20 characters wide with 2 characters to the right
of the decimal point.
(name) %(name)d Get the value from the supplied dictionary using name as the key.

Time Module
In the time module there is a function called time that will return the current system clock time
in seconds since some arbitrary starting point.
